- `--speed-test-duration`: Duration of speed test in seconds (default: 5)
- `--speed-check-interval`: Interval for speed checks and rate limiting updates in seconds (default: 5)

## Download Strategy

The tool implements an intelligent size-based download strategy:

1. **File Classification**:
   - Small files (<200MB by default)
   - Big files (>200MB by default)
   - Configurable size threshold
   - Fallback size retrieval for API issues

2. **Download Priority**:
   - Small files downloaded first using all threads
   - Big files processed after small files complete
   - Ensures efficient resource utilization
   - Handles missing file sizes gracefully

3. **Speed Optimization**:
   - Initial speed test for first big file
   - Dynamic thread allocation based on speed
   - Percentage-based speed allocation per thread
   - Minimum 1 MB/s per thread safeguard
   - Adaptive performance optimization

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Real-time speed statistics
   - Per-file progress monitoring
   - Thread utilization tracking
   - Clear status updates
   - Improved error reporting

## Thread Management
The tool uses an intelligent thread allocation strategy optimized for different system sizes:

1. **Small Files**:
   - Uses optimal thread count based on system capabilities
   - Conservative allocation for low-core systems (1-2 cores: 2-4 threads)
   - Balanced allocation for medium systems (3-8 cores: 2x cores)
   - Scaled allocation for high-core systems (>8 cores: 3x cores, max 32)
   - Quick completion of small files

2. **Big Files**:
   - Initial single-thread speed test
   - Dynamic thread allocation based on speed
   - Each thread gets configurable percentage of total speed
   - Minimum speed safeguards (3 MB/s per thread)
   - Adaptive performance optimization

3. **System Resources**:
   - Smart thread scaling based on CPU cores
   - Network-aware thread management
   - Dynamic performance adjustment
   - Resource monitoring with safety limits
   - Cross-platform file locking

## Speed Management

The tool implements an advanced speed optimization system:

1. **Speed Testing**:
   - Initial speed test for big files
   - Average speed calculation
   - Thread optimization based on speed
   - Percentage-based speed allocation
   - Edge case handling

2. **Thread Allocation**:
   - Dynamic thread count for big files
   - Based on speed test results
   - Each thread gets X% of total speed (configurable)
   - Minimum speed safeguards
   - Ensures optimal performance

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Real-time speed statistics
   - Active thread monitoring
   - Overall progress tracking
   - Clear status updates
   - Better error reporting

## State Management

The tool provides robust state management:

1. **State Validation**:
   - Schema validation for state files
   - Corruption detection and recovery
   - Safe state persistence
   - Clear error reporting
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms

2. **Token Management**:
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Configurable refresh intervals
   - Safe token handling
   - Clear authentication errors
   - Graceful token updates

3. **File Integrity**:
   - Hybrid hashing (BLAKE3 for large files)
   - SHA256 compatibility with API
   - Pre-allocated file space
   - 5% disk space safety buffer
   - Clear integrity reporting

## Directory Structure

Downloads are organized by model name:
```
downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model1_name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.safetensors
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .download_state    # Progress tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model2_name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.safetensors
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .download_state    # Progress tracking
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Best Practices

1. **Download Strategy**:
   - Let small files download first
   - Allow speed testing for big files
   - Use default thread optimization
   - Monitor download progress
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

2. **Configuration**:
   - Adjust file size threshold based on network
   - Set min-speed-percentage based on stability needs
   - Allow dynamic thread allocation
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Use appropriate timeouts

3. **System Resources**:
   - Tool manages threads optimally for I/O
   - Prevents system overload
   - Maintains responsiveness
   - Enables safe interruption
   - Uses cross-platform file locking

4. **Interruptions**:
   - Safe to interrupt with Ctrl+C
   - Progress is saved automatically
   - Downloads can be resumed safely
   - State is properly maintained
   - Clear error reporting
